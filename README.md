 During this process, I've been confronted with a number of problems. My pictures were too large at first, and I tried a variety of solutions to change their size, but it didn't seem to work. After that, I adjusted the images to resolve this issue. I've also had problems with my navbar. When I added CSS styling, it didn't work as expected, so I went back to look at my HTML code. The next thing I knew, my CSS link was not properly typed.

 -I used the bootstarp pluggins and the animation pluggins 
 -All my images and the website name are my own
 -i used the visual code font
